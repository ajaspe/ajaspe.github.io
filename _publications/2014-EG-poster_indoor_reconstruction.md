abstract: "Reconstructing the architectural shape of indoor environments is a problem that is gaining increasing attention in the field of computer graphics. While some solutions have been proposed in recent years, cluttered environments with multiple rooms and non-vertical walls still represent a challenging input for state-of-the-art methods. We propose an occlusions-aware pipeline that extends current solutions to work with complex environments with arbitrary wall orientations."
