abstract: "We discuss virtual staging technologies, focusing on two primary pipelines for creating and exploring immersive indoor environments in the metavers: an AI-based image processing pipeline and a LIDAR-based pipeline. The AI-based image processing pipeline leverages advanced AI algorithms for tasks such as clutter removal, semantic style transfer, and super-resolution, enabling rapid generation of high-quality, photorealistic virtual environments from single panoramic images. The LIDAR-based pipeline captures measurable 3D models of indoor spaces, facilitating immersive editing and collaborative design through real-time interaction with high-fidelity virtual environments.  A qualitative comparative analysis of these technologies highlights their strengths and limitations in various applications. The practical implications of these pipelines are discussed, particularly their potential to transform industries such as real estate, furniture retail, interior design, construction, remote collaboration, and immersive training. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research, including conducting user studies, integrating the two pipelines, and optimizing technologies for mobile and edge devices to enhance accessibility and usability."
