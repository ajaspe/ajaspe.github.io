abstract: "This lab presentation briefly describes the Visual Computing group of the CRS4 research center. Established in 1996, the group primarily focuses on the study, development, and application of technology for acquisition, storage, processing, distribution, and interactive exploration of complex objects and environments. Research is widely published in major journals and conferences, and many of the developed technologies are used (or have been used) in as diverse real-world applications as internet geoviewing, scientific data analysis, surgical training, and cultural heritage study and valorization."
