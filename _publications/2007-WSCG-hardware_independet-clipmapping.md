abstract: "We present a technique for efficient management of large textures and its real-time application to geometric models. Theproposed technique is inspired by theclipmap idea, that caches in video memory a subset of the texture mipmap pyramid.Based on this concept, we define some structures and a different management allowing its implementation on a personalcomputer without specific graphics hardware. Finally, we present the results of the application in a terrain visualization system,using several simultaneous textures with a detail up to 0.25 meters per texel, covering a 60,000 km2area."
