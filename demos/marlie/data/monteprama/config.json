    "info": "<p>One of the statues from the <a href=\"http://publications.crs4.it/pubdocs/2015/BJMMGP15/\">Mont'e Prama collection</a>, which includes 25 life-size human figures, depicting archers, boxers and warriors, and 13 building models representing typical Nuragic towers. This statue is one of the best preserved items representing an archer (Archer n.5 - Prexiau). It has been acquired using a combination of laser scanning and flash photography to recover shape and albedo of complete 3D models. The fixed view used in the annotated model visualization has been chosen to display a set of important features from the CH point of view, and has been resampled at the resolution of approximately 0.25mm/pixel. In this view, it is possible to see the quiver (with the resin box and the small sword), and the left arm, which holds the bow.
