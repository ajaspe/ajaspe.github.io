abstract: "This paper describes the design, production and implementation of an application for the formal analysis of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. The geometrical complexity of the model of this building for the level of detail required, derived from the profusion of stylistic elements present, that constitutes one of its signs of identity leaded to use the progressive refinement radiosity method to generate a model which could be handled in real-time, adding the visual quality of globalillumination, to be implemented in an application that allows the user to interactively inspect and cross-section the model."
