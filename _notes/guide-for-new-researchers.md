# Guide for new Visual Computing researchers
This small guide aims to be a quick-start introduction to common terms, procedures for a computer science researcher. Some aspect will be generic, and other will be more oriented to the field of Visual Computing, specifically to Computer Graphics and Visualization.
## Measuring research impact

### Researcher impact
Measuring the impact of your research is not an easy task, and many factors should be taking into account, such as the research field, the current career step, etc. But there are probably three main measures (the ones used in [Google Schoolar](http://scholar.google.com)):
* `Number of citations`: Sum of the citations of all your publications
* `h-index`: number h of publications with h citations
* `i10-index`: number of publications with at least 10 citations

### Journal impact
