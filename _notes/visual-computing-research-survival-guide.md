This small guide aims to be a quick-start introduction to common terms, procedures for a computer science researcher. Some aspect will be generic, and other will be more oriented to the field of Visual Computing, specifically to Computer Graphics and Visualization.

## How to find a research topic
That is your advisor responsability :) Appart of that, there are some places for inspiration:
* [SIGGraph Course: Open problems in real-time rendering](https://openproblems.realtimerendering.com/): SIGGraph course of 2015, 16, 17 by different researchers.
* [T. Funkhouser: Five principles for choosing research problems in computer graphics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Qaf8t8I6c): SIGGraph 2015 talk as Computer Graphics Achievement Award.
* **Visualization challenges**:
	- IEEE Vis challenges
	- [Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.org/challenges)
	- [Harvard Visualization Corner](/https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/publications/nih-nsf-visualization-research-challenges-report/paper)

## Measuring research impact
We like to measure the impact of our research, not only because us humans are competitive, but also for understanding better the value of our work and planning future efforts.

### Journal impact
 The impact factor of a journal try to measure its importance on its field, normally by taking into account number of citations of its articles, number of articles published along the year, etc.
 The most important are:
 * __Journal Citation Report (JCR)__: Blah
 * __Scopus__: Blah
 * __Eigenfactor__: Blah

### Conference impact
Quartiles and blah

### Researcher impact
Measuring the impact of your research is not an easy task, and many factors should be taking into account, such as the research field, the current career step, etc. But there are probably three main measures:
* __Number of citations__: Sum of the citations of all your publications
* __h-index__: number h of publications with h citations
* __i10-index__: number of publications with at least 10 citations

### Tips for tracking your impact
* [ORCID](https://orcid.org): Blah
* [Google Schoolar](http://scholar.google.com): blah
